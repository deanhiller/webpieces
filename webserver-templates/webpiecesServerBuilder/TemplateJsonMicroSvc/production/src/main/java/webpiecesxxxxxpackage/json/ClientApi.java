 * In our microservices architecture using webpieces
 * 1. We make every method async as you can always use the methods synchronously by calling method(request).get() and it's synchronous
 * 2. You can put sync methods on top of async ones BUT you can't truly do the reverse since the sync method is blocking a thread, it is not truly async
 *    (ie. the idea being not to lock up threads when using async methods)
 * 3. BOTH client(typically generated with ClientCreator) and server implement this same API so changes
