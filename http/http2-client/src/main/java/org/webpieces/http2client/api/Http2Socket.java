     *  2. send request headers only, then receive response headers and data chunks until end chunk is received
     *     -With this, you can stream chunks through your system so it works for very very large file use-cases without
     *      storing the whole file in RAM as you can stream it through the system
     *  3. send request headers, then stream request chunks forever (this is sometimes a use-case)
